As no data stream was supplied by the researchers, artificial data needed to be generated
for the sake of testing and using our recreation of the examined Event Processing approach.
To make runs reproducible and to make the computational cost of the generation negligible
for the algorithm's runtime, this data is generated independently and stored in csv files
as opposed to generating the events in the live system.
Each data point consists of an integer value timestamp, a key string called 'user' and
an integer value called 'account\_balance', all of which are randomized according to certain rules.
Several parameters can be adjusted to generate datasets with different properties.
Our used datasets have 5 million data points and a maximum 'account\_balance' value of 1,000,000 each,
mostly we used a dataset with unique usernames to ensure that the FlatFAT is full at all times.
Additionally we used two datasets with 20 and 500 unique usernames only
which forces a high rate of updates as opposed to evicting and inserting those tuples.
All datasets have their timestamps strictly monotonously increasing (FIFO)
but non-FIFO data can also be generated with a parameter.
