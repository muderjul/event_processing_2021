We wanted to compare the general results for operators of the Reactive Aggregator approach from the original paper~\cite{GeneralIncremental15}
with our own implementation, solely focussing on the ArgMax operator. We achieved to reproduce some of the figures to a certain degree, but our running cost exceeds those of the original implementation (see \autoref{obtained_results}).
