# Task

Topic 2: ArgMax in Sliding-Window Aggregation

Group: Harnisch, Philipp; Herrmann, Richard; Muders, Julian

Paper: http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p702-tangwongsan.pdf

Task: Develop a simple streaming aggregator in your favourite programming language based on the Reactive Aggregator (RA) framework presented in the paper. LImit yourself to the ArgMax operator over a sliding time-based window (some hard-coding of the operator is fine, no parsing of a query specification, etc, is required).  Implement the computation of the operator according to the lift/combine/lower functions, but keep the implementation to the bare essentials (neglect the optimizations mentioned in the paper). Run the implementation for a stream of synthetic data and explore the behaviour of the operator when changing the window size.

# Submission

By the deadline, submit a PDF report per group with your results in Moodle
Use the VLDB template to prepare your report (Latex or Word):
https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/format.html
Using this template, I would expect the report to have a length of around 4 pages, incl.
figures (e.g. the experimental pipeline), plots, etc.
Make sure to include names of all group members
Suggested structure for the report:
– Goal and scope
– Applied method
– Obtained results
– Discussion/Conclusion
